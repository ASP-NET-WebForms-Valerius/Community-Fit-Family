The exercises we do are focused on building the body capable of doing real life activities in a real live positions. We don't insulate single muscle or muscle groups, because we treat it as a whole bio-mechanical machine. It is not only about lifting weights and pumping out in an idealized posture, created by expensive machines. let you body do natural movements in a most floating way.
